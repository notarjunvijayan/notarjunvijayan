### Hi


I'm Arjun
<br>Or I'm not? (username pun intended)

Ok I was just kidding :no_mouth:
<br>I'm Arjun V, an Engineering student in Rajagiri School of Engineering and Technology, Kochi who just loves to code. Trying to learn new things that I'm geniunely interested in and trying to implement them by making small-scale applications(or projects, if you can call them that) for a sense of accomplishment.
